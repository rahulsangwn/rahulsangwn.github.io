      <description>In this post we are going to write a simple bootloader program that can be loaded by the x86 based computers.
When computer starts, BIOS will always start our CPU in 16-bit mode (also known as Real mode). Then it will search for boot sector on the attached storage devices like hard disks. Boot sector is 512 bytes of storage with its last 2 btyes as &amp;lsquo;0xaa&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;0x55&amp;rsquo; (last two bytes act as signature for the boot sector).</description>
